# My Personal Project for CPSC 210

## Project Description and Overview

**For my term project, I will be creating a group bill manager.**  
The application will basically take entries of bills for a group.  
The app would be able to split it among the group (by ratio) and keep track of who owes who within a group.  
For example you have a group of four with people, “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D”, and person A pays for one bill.  
Person D then pays for another.  The app would be able to return the net amount that one person owes someone  
(if person D paid for a bill but less than what person A,  
the difference would be displayed as how much Person D owes person A).  
Sometimes someone in the group might not get anything, so they would not owe anyone anything.  
Some people who would use this app are groups of friends who would  
like to know how much they have spent with each other. This project is of interest to me because I have a great  
group of friends and at different times we pay for different things.  I would like to know how much we owe each other  
for those bills and one day be able to return how much we owe each other.
